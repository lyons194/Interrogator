"""Beginning of Interrogator
This verison of Interrogator will ask the user to supply their age, name and address.
The code is supposed to screen users' answers to make sure that they enter in an answer that makes sense.
A good example of this is making sure that the user doesn't answer "ae" for their age, etc.
